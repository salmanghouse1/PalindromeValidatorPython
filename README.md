# Palindrome validator

A palindrome is  a word, verse, or sentence (such as "Able was I ere I saw
Elba") or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward
[(Merriam-Webster)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palindrome)

In this assignment, you will elaborate an algorithm which will validate that an
input string is a palindrome using the `deque` data type and its
unique high-performance features.


### Requirements
Using TDD to develop the algorithm, write a single function which will accept a
single parameter like so:

```python
is_palindrome(value: str) -> bool
```
